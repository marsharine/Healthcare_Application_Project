# Project Title: Healthcare Issue Tracking System
# Sprint 2: 

Description: This project involves developing a Healthcare Issue Tracking System, designed to enable users to report, track, and manage healthcare-related issues or incidents effectively. The application aims to enhance user engagement by providing a structured approach to issue management, demonstrating both my understanding of web development and practical application of technical skills.

Key Features:

User Registration & Authentication: Secure user access to the system.
Issue Reporting Form: Simple interface for users to report healthcare issues.
Issue Status Tracking: Users can view the status of reported issues (open, in progress, resolved).
User Dashboard: A dedicated space for users to manage their reported issues.
Admin Panel: (Optional) An interface for administrators to oversee reported issues.
Technical Stack:

Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React or Vue.js for a responsive and interactive UI.
Backend: Node.js and Express.js to handle server requests and manage data.
Database: MongoDB or PostgreSQL for storing healthcare issue data.
API: RESTful API for seamless communication between frontend and backend.
Testing: Jest for backend unit testing and Cypress for frontend integration testing.
Styling: Bootstrap or Tailwind CSS for responsive design.
Version Control: Git & GitHub for collaboration and project management.
Development Plan:

Requirements Gathering: Define features, including user roles and issue tracking capabilities.
Project Setup: Initialize Git repository and set up project structure.
Frontend Development: Create user-friendly interfaces and implement navigation.
Backend Development: Set up a server with API endpoints for user interactions.
API Development: Develop RESTful endpoints for managing user data and reported issues.
Testing: Conduct unit and integration tests to ensure application functionality.
Deployment: Deploy the application on platforms like Heroku or Vercel.
Documentation: Create comprehensive project documentation, including setup instructions and user guides.

Optional Enhancements:
Implement user notifications for issue updates.
Introduce role-based access for different user types.
Add search and filter functionality for reported issues.
Integrate a charting library for visualizing issue statistics.
This project serves as a practical application of my web development skills while addressing real-world challenges in the healthcare domain.
